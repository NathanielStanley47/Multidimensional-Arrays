# My Multidimensional Arrays Program

This program demonstrates how to display the elements of a multidimensional array using two for loops. Each element of the array is accessed by iterating through rows and columns and printed to the console.

⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo 
2. Open in Visual Studio 2022 (not compatible with VS code) 
3. Build and run

🧩 How it works

- A multidimensional array is declared and initialized
- The outer for loop iterates through the rows of the array
- The inner for loop iterates through the colums of each row
- Each element is displayed in order
  
🧠 Concepts Used

- Multidimensiional arrays
- Nested for loops
- Array indexing
